## For Model
- add Car class
- add constant variable with car properties field
- add attr_accessor for Car, purpose is possible get and set value to car field
- When call a new Car object it will auto add field to object
- method call will add value to field

## For seed data
- init car properties
- use constant variable and call method of instance object for build data

NOTE: I create a nhk_assignment file for running both rspec and code
